<h2>Data Privacy Notice "COVID&nbsp;Trace" App</h2>
<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
<p>
The purpose of this privacy notice is to explain how the COVID Trace App (the 'app') works, what data is collected by
the app, who has access to that data and the purposes for which the data is used.
</p>
<p>
The app is available to download for free from the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. Use of the app by you is
completely voluntary - it is your choice to download it, your choice to keep it on your device, your choice to opt-in to
and use the different services that are available on the app, and your choice to delete it. You can withdraw your
consent(s) at any time.</p>

<h3>2. What the app does</h3>
<p>
The app has the purpose of supporting the national public health response and members of the public during the COVID-19
crisis. The app has the following functions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Exposure Notification - to notify you as quickly as possible should you have been in close and sustained contact with
someone who has tested positive.</li> 
<li>News and Information - to give you trusted and convenient facts and figures about coronavirus (COVID-19) in Nevada.</li>
<li>Other Functions - the app can collect anonymous metric data so that the State of Nevada and the Department of Health
and Human Services ("DHHS") public health teams can monitor how the app is contributing to the response efforts and get
a better understanding of the spread of the virus. Removing the app from your phone will delete all data.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. About the COVID Trace App</h3>
<h3>3.1 How Exposure Notification works</h3>
<p>Existing manual contact tracing processes (i.e. where people tell us by phone or in person who they have been in contact
with) rely on people being able to remember who they have been in contact with recently, and how long that contact
lasted for. In many cases people do not know
who they have been in contact with (for example, if the contact occurred on a bus or train, at a concert, a restaurant
or some other public venue).</p>
<p>
The app uses technology developed by Apple and Google called COVID-19 Exposure Alerts where anonymous rolling
identifiers are exchanged between mobile phones. Exposure Alerts enable your phone to generate a random, unique
identifier every 10 to 20 minutes. If you are close to another phone that also has Exposure Alerts turned on, your
identifier will be saved on that person's phone and your phone will record their identifier. All identifiers will remain
on your phone, although neither you nor anyone else will be able to see them. These anonymous identifiers cannot
identify you to other users or to the State of Nevada.</p>
<p>If you subsequently receive a positive COVID-19 diagnosis, you will receive a call from the Contact Tracing Center
('CTC') within the State of Nevada. You will be asked if you are using the Contact Tracing feature on the app and, if
you are, you can choose to upload your own identifiers to assist the contact tracing process. To do this, the CTC will
provide you a code over the phone, when entered into the app, unlocks an upload function. You can then choose to upload
your identifiers to a State of Nevada Registry where the identifiers are published publicly and are referred to as
Diagnosis Keys.</p>
<p>Every two (Android) to four hours (iPhone), the latest Diagnosis Keys from the State of Nevada Registry will be
downloaded by every user's phone. These will be used to check for matches against the identifiers that have been
collected by your phone. If there is a match indicating that you were in sustained close contact with a person who was
diagnosed with COVID-19, you will be notified in the app . This is called a 'Potential Exposure Alert'.</p>
<p>For all this to work, you have to turn on the Apple/Google Exposure Alerts service on your phone. You will be presented
with an option to allow the app to use this service and to turn this service on during the initial screens after you
have installed the app. You can change your mind and turn this service on or off at any time through the app settings.</p>
<p>
If you get a Potential Exposure Alert, a message will display prominently within the app. You can also choose to allow
the app to display a phone notification in the event of a Potential Exposure Alert. You will be asked if you wish to
allow Alerts during the initial screens after you have installed the app. You can change your mind and turn this service
on or off at any time through the app settings.</p>
<p>In the event you receive a Potential Exposure Alert, you may want to speak to someone in the Department of Health. For
this to happen you will can initiate a call to the Department of Health hotline from the app. This is optional.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the Contact Tracing feature never reveals the identity of any person using the app to other
app users, and never reveals who has been diagnosed positive. Also, if you don't want to contact the State of Nevada,
the State of Nevada will not know if you receive a Potential Exposure Alert.</p>
<h3>3.3 What News and Information is</h3>
<p>The app will provide you with the latest updates about coronavirus (COVID-19) in State of Nevada. While this information
is already available on <a href="https://nvhealthresponse.nv.gov">https://nvhealthresponse.nv.gov</a>, the app might display the key numbers in an easily accessible
way within the app. This includes statistics such as the total number of confirmed cases, number of deaths, numbers
hospitalized, and the number of cases per county.</p>
<h3>3.4 What app metrics are collected</h3>
<p> Metrics can be collected and sent to the State of Nevada to enable the State of Nevada, DHHS and public health teams to
understand your use of the app, its effectiveness as part of the pandemic response, and how to improve it. Metric data
does not identify you and is used to create aggregate views of how the app is being used and the impact it is having on
the virus. Here is a list of the app metrics which, if you consent, are collected from your app.</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether the app on your phone is in use</li>
<li>Whether the app completed setup</li>
<li>Whether the app has received a Potential Exposure Alert</li>
<li>Whether the app has uploaded diagnosis keys</li>
<li>The number of diagnosis key matches per Potential Exposure Alert</li>
<li>Number of days between the app triggering a Potential Exposure Alert and the upload of diagnosis keys, if applicable</li>
<li>Whether a call was initiated to the Department of Health from the app</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. What data is collected and processed</h3>
<p>The information processed by the app is anonymous data.</p>
<p>This information is processed in 3 different ways, depending whether the information has been
provided by:</p>
<ul>
<li>you the user (should you choose to provide it);</li>
<li>the Exposure Alert service;</li>
<li>your phone or the app.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4.1 The Exposure Alerts service</h3>
<p>In respect of the Contact Tracing function, the following data is processed for the operation of Exposure Alerts running
on your phone if you turn it on.</p>
<ul>
<li>Identifiers sent and received between phones that have the service turned on.<li>
<li>Identifiers (diagnosis keys) uploaded to the State of Nevada Registry if you are COVID-19 positive and you agree to upload them.</li>
<li>Identifiers (diagnosis keys) downloaded from the State of Nevada Registry to all apps for matching.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The above identifiers are pseudo-random alpha numeric values that cannot be used to identify you or anyone else. These
are generated, collected and matched on your phone only if you enable Exposure Alerts.</p>

<h3>4.2 Provided by your phone or the app</h3>
<p>As a consequence of how network traffic passes across the Internet, your Internet Protocol (IP) address is also
inevitably transferred to State of Nevada servers. An IP address is typically made up of 4 sets of numbers (e.g.
1.2.3.4) and is assigned to you by your mobile phone or Wi-Fi service provider. Under the data protection law your IP
address is generally regarded as personal data.</p>
<p>During the initial screens after installation the app carries out tests to verify if the app is a valid State of Nevada
app and the phone is a real device. On confirmation, the app connects to the State of Nevada servers and exchanges
security tokens to protect the app backend from security attacks. The security tokens are not used to identify you, and
are used to check that the Internet traffic coming from the app during its lifetime is from a real COVID Tracker App
running on a real phone.</p>
<p>While your data transmitted between the app and the State of Nevada servers includes the IP address and it is considered
personal data, the State of Nevada does not use your IP address to identify you. Your IP address is removed at the
'front door' of the State of Nevada servers and any information shared is stripped of the IP address and cannot be
linked back to you using this address. Only a strong hash (SHA256) of the IP address is stored to help prevent abuse.</p>
<p>Metric data is collected by the app and is shared with the State of Nevada as described previously.</p>

<h3>5. You Consent to the Collection of Data</h3>
<p>The app is voluntary to use. Your use of the App means that you consent to the collection and use of the data collected
by your use of the App. If you no longer consent, the app can be deleted removing the associated data.</p>

<h3>6. Security measures</h3>
<p>All data stored on your phone is encrypted by the app using the built-in encryption capability of your phone. Data is
also encrypted when it is uploaded to our servers.</p>
<p>The Contact Tracing feature uses a fully 'decentralized' privacy model. This means that identifier and diagnosis key
matches are made locally on your phone. Matches are not made externally by the State of Nevada. This ensures no tracking
of people's movements or who they contact can be done.</p>
<p>There are a range of security processes and technologies in place to prevent unauthorized access to the data while it is
stored on our servers, including data encryption, modern firewalls and intrusion prevention.</p>
<p>When information such as diagnosis keys and symptoms are uploaded to State of Nevada servers with your IP address, the
IP address is stripped from the information at the earliest possible opportunity to ensure it cannot be used in any way
to re-identify the person that uploaded the information.</p>

<h3>7. Who processes your data</h3>
<p>The State of Nevada is responsible for running the app and all infrastructure required to operate and maintain the app
and backend servers.</p>
<h3>7.1 Data Processors</h3>
<p>There are a number of data processors who provide services to the app for the State of Nevada.</p>
<p>The following companies will have access to your information.</p>
<p>COVID Trace are the app developers who will provide technical support on the running
of the app.</p>
<p>The following companies provide services to the State of Nevada but do not have access to your data.</p>

<p>Google Cloud Platform (GCP) provide cloud storage and cloud services for the data uploaded from your phone. This is
processed in Nevada</p>
<p>Contracts are in place between the State of Nevada and each of these third-party processors which set out the
processors' obligations and the State of Nevada's obligations and rights with regard to the personal data that is being
processed.</p>
<p>Apple and Google - the app can be downloaded free of charge from the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. In this
regard they are independent controllers as they process account names in order to make the app available. This
processing activity is separate to the processing of personal data on the app. Furthermore, although Apple and Google
have developed a COVID-19 Exposure Alerts service, which is used in the app, neither company obtain any personal data
from the app or the Exposure Alerts service itself.</p>
<h3>7.2 Other recipients</h3>
<p>The State of Nevada anonymizes any app metric data that it receives from app users. This anonymized data is shared with
the Department of Health and Human Services ('DHHS').</p>
<p>The DHHS will carry out statistical analysis on the information shared with it, which it will publish in line with its
remit Department of Health, the Health Response, the State of Nevada, and to the public as appropriate.</p>
<h3>8. How long your personal data is held for</h3>
<h4>Exposure Alerts Service identifiers on your device (Contact Tracing function):</h4>
<p>This information is retained on your phone for 14 days. 14 days is considered a window of epidemiological significance
that generally covers the potential for viral transmission.</p>
<h4>Diagnosis keys in State of Nevada registry (Contact Tracing function):</h4>
<p>This information is retained for 14 days. As above, 14 days is considered a window of epidemiological significance that
generally covers the potential for viral transmission.</p>
<h4>Diagnosis keys on your device (Contact Tracing function):</h4>
<p>This information is retained for as long as is necessary to perform a match check and is deleted thereafter.</p>
<h4>App metrics:</h4>
<p>This anonymous information is retained by the State of Nevada for a minimum of 7 years and is reviewed at that stage for
extension or deletion depending on its health value. This data is retained for the purposes of monitoring the efficacy
of the app and improving it.</p>
<h3>9. Changes to this Data Privacy Notice</h3>
<p>This Data Privacy Notice may change from time to time and you will receive notification of this update in the app.</p>
